# Ecommerce funnel analysis

Funnel analysis dashboard based on GA4 public dataset using BigQuery and Looker Studio.  
This dashboard shows how users move through an ecommerce sales funnel.  
The data comes from the public GA4 BigQuery dataset. I used SQL to prepare the data and visualized it in Looker Studio.

### Tools used
- BigQuery for writing the SQL query  
- Looker Studio for building the dashboard  
- Google Analytics 4 public dataset as the data source  

### What the dashboard includes
- A funnel chart showing each step: session start, view item, add to cart, checkout, purchase  
- Filters for traffic source, device type, landing page, and more  
- Charts showing purchases over time and top traffic sources
